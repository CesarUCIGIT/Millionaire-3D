Millionaire-3D
==============

An attempt to create a 100% replica of a favorite TV show "Who Wants To Be a Millionaire" using Unity 3D.

All fans are welcome to contributing - either by writing code, designing graphics replicas, creating your questions, providing voiceovers for characters. 


What is done so far
-------------------

* Created question bar (logenze) for classic Millionaire format using new unity UI (you must have Unity 4.6).

* The source logenze image Assets/Graphics/Logenze/Classic.png is Full-HD and is divided into 9 sprites:
  1. Question
  2. Left answer (either A or C) active (with an orange diamond)
  3. Right answer (either B or D) active (with an orange diamond)
  4. Left answer inactive (when the answer is removed by a 50x50 lifeline)
  5. Right answer inactive (when the answer is removed by a 50x50 lifeline)
  6. Left answer final (orange background)
  7. Right answer final (orange background)
  8. Left answer correct (green background)
